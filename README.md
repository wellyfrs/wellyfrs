# Hi there 👋

I build reliable, scalable solutions to real-world problems using solid **Software Architecture** and **Data Science**.

Most of my experience is in the **financial sector**, including at [N26](https://n26.com), where I've contributed to fraud, money laundering, and financial terrorism detection.

I have been tech-savvy from an early age and am deeply hands-on, backed by formal education in **Computer Science** and **Statistics**, and certified in **Java**, **AWS**, and a few more.

Originally from **Brazil**, now based in **Barcelona** with my wife and children, I enjoy spending time outdoors, travel journaling, and educating myself.

### Projects

- Creator of [**PixSim**](https://github.com/wellyfrs/pixsim), a simulator for Brazil's instant payment system, designed for fraud detection research and testing.
- [**Biblemark**](https://github.com/wellyfrs/biblemark) and [**DjForms**](https://github.com/wellyfrs/djforms) are examples from courses and experiments I've enjoyed exploring.
- I also share notes and exercises from ongoing studies, such as [**Selikoff-Boyarsky**](https://github.com/wellyfrs/selikoff-boyarsky).
- Author of [**Codex Memor**](https://codexmemor.com), my personal blog.
- I am maintaining a personal **serverless micro-SaaS** project (in progress).

### Skills

I prefer focusing on the fundamentals over specific tools or languages, with particular interest in **Domain-Driven Design**, **Distributed Systems**, **Extreme Programming**, **Data Engineering**, and **Machine Learning** concepts.

That said, I work comfortably with a broad range of technologies, historically within the **JVM** ecosystem, expanding a bit day by day.
